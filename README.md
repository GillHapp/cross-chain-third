# Token Staking Platform

This repository contains the source code for a decentralized staking platform that enables users to stake their tokens and earn rewards. By staking, users lock their tokens in smart contracts for a specified period, allowing them to earn interest or governance tokens as rewards. The platform supports multiple tokens and is built for secure, transparent, and user-friendly staking.

## Key Features
1. **Multi-Token Support**: Users can stake different types of ERC-20 tokens.
2. **Reward Distribution**: Users earn staking rewards based on the length and amount of tokens staked.
3. **Flexible Staking Options**: Choose different lock-up periods based on desired rewards.
4. **Automatic Reward Calculation**: Rewards are calculated based on smart contract logic and distributed automatically.
5. **Unstaking**: Users can withdraw their staked tokens after the lock-up period ends.
6. **Real-Time Data**: Monitor staking status, rewards, and token value in real-time.

## How It Works
1. Users deposit their tokens into a staking contract.
2. The tokens are locked for a predefined period.
3. During this time, users earn rewards, which accumulate in real-time.
4. Once the staking period is complete, users can withdraw both their staked tokens and earned rewards.


## How to Stake
1. Approve the staking contract to spend your tokens.
2. Call the `stake` function with the amount of tokens and duration.
3. Track your rewards and unstake when the lock-up period ends.
